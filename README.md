### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent of Le Wagon. I'm passionate about learning new things, at the moment coding and web development. My long-term goal is to create a successful technology company, and I'm currently working on developing the skills and knowledge I need to make it happen. 

With my business background and my coding skills, I'm confident that I can bring something special to the table and make a real impact.
